                In December 2018, I took my first trip to the United States of America to visit aunty Kirsis for the holidays.
                Distance kept us apart, but we were rapidly catching up on every single detail of our lives. While I was in Ohio, the first thing that
                I noticed was that people weren't speaking Spanish anymore.
                They were speaking English, an unexplored and bizarre language to me.
                My curiosity rapidly drove me to try to understand the language. I tried to understand the conversations, jokes or, simple expressions like “That is a beautiful car.” I couldn't understand anything.
                Everything I heard was a bunch of random sounds from people who spoke fast. At this point, my 15 year-old-self was motivated by this new challenge and I promised myself that I was going to speak such a beautiful language.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember Aunty told me to watch movies, series, and TV shows with her to introduce the language.
                Even though I still did not understand anything at all, I was spending quality time with family and having fun while I was learning.
                We would spend tireless hours watching English movies on Netflix. Another one of the strategies we used was learning the language through music, enjoying the rhythm and flow of songs, and trying to understand what their lyrics meant.
                She would play the song once to introduce me to the rhythm and flow of the music. Then, I would listen again as she told me how to pronounce the lyrics and what they all meant. I learned many songs by breaking them down into little pieces, which helped me discover new words.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was Christmas Eve, Aunty Kirsis and I were in the living room full of many holiday decorations, and a tall tree covered in lights and ornaments.
                Seated next to each other on the couch. Christmas spirit was high, and the Christmas lights were on as she pulled up the lyrics of a new song on her phone.
                I was excited to know the next song that I was going to listen to. She started singing, “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas”.
                I thought it was so funny as I tried to repeat it and could not pronounce the word “hippopotamus.” It was a large, complicated, and extremely difficult word to pronounce for me.
                But, after a long hour and more than 50 repetitions, my mouth, lips, and tongue finally got the ideal coordination to be able to sing “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas.”
            </p>
            <p>
                After Christmas, it was time to come back home to the Dominican Republic. I was more motivated than ever to learn how to speak English.
                The Marco that went to the United States was not the same that came back home. I was inspired and committed to speaking English. I started watching Teen Wolf, a TV show about a teenager that becomes a werewolf every day.
                I also changed the language on my iPad to be English and tried to meet friends from English countries to chat about simple things like the difference between their culture and my Dominican culture.
                In a few short weeks, I made my world where the internet was a way to learn a new language.
            </p>
            <p>
                My 15 year old would be proud of myself that I'm finally able to speak the language after this.
                I found out that I can make a difference in my community by cofounding Aguilas Amigas, a school organization that offers free tutoring to people that need the same process that I did.
                Learning a new language could be challenging, just the fact that you can’t pronounce “hippopotamus“ could make a mark for the rest of your life.
                But, you learn new ways to understand and make yourself understood in new code. English is language, language is culture, culture is people, and people are love.
